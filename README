To build the stann_backend module required by stann.py, you must run build_swig.sh
This shell script requires swig 3.0.10 and this script may be modified to look
for swig in a different path. The build make take 3-5 minutes due to template
compilation.

This repository contains a copy of the include directory from STANN but none of the
STANN headers have been modified so the script may be configured to look elsewhere
for the STANN headers.

To test, you may run stann_tests.py, which runs a battery of unit tests based on
the test.cpp in STANN's source repository.

When the library is built, a directory called stann is placed in the distrib
directory, this directory may be used as a the package directory and distributed
as a regular python package.
